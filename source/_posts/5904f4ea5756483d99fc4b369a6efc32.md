**Safety Catches**

Provide safety catches to the relevant windows referred to above. The safety catches must be such that they can be easy to override, by an adult, in the event of a fire occurring. The catches must restrict the distance a window can be opened to a maximum of 100mm, to reduce the possibility of an accident involving a child. An alternative method of minimising this hazard may be acceptable, but any proposal should be discussed with the appropriate case officer prior to executing works.
