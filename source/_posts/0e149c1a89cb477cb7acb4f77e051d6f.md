**Rebuilt Brickwork**

Take down unstable brick built wall complete to existing foundations excavating to expose as necessary and providing support at all levels to ensure continued stability of building.

Rebuild brick wall in sound salvaged bricks, or new bricks to match, bedded in sand/cement (3:1) mortar, to original configuration in accordance with current Building Regulations ensuring mechanical bonding at all floor levels and at roof level and lateral restraint throughout entire length and height of wall with joint struck to match other brick elevations as work proceeds.

Backfill and consolidate all exposed foundations.

(The Councilâ€™s Building Control Officer should be consulted in this instance)
