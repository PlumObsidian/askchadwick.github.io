**Draught proofing to casement window**

Supply and fit draught strips with a compression allowance of 3mm to the Georgian wired casement window on the rear external wall on the half landing between the ground and first floor on the right side of the building. Products should be manufactured to the current BS 7386 and installed to the current BS 7880. Ensure only strips recommended by a manufacturer for the actual gap size are used.
