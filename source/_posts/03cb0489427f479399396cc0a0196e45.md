**Replace bath**

Disconnect the bath from the existing services in the **XXX** and clear away.

Supply and fix a new enamelled pressed steel bath (positioned in original site) complete with 38 mm chromium plated combined waste and overflow, l pair 19 mm chromium plated pillar taps, 38 mm bath plug, suitable length of chromium plated retaining chain with edges let into abutting walls and made good on completion. Ensure both water feeds have maintenance valves incorporated so that taps can be maintained without the need to drain down the water supply.

Make good all works disturbed.
