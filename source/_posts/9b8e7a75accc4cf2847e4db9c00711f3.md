**Replace wash hand basin**

Remove the **XXX** wash basin. Supply and position a new vitreous china or other suitable wash basin, complete with overflow and 32mm (1 1/4") chromium plated waste, two 15mm (1/2") taps and a 32mm plug complete with a suitable length of retaining chain. Supply and fit a 32mm waste trap to the waste fitting and properly connect to the waste pipe. Ensure both water feeds have maintenance valves incorporated so that taps can be maintained without the need to drain down the water supply.

Supply and fit a 32mm plastic trap, properly connected to a waste pipe and made to discharge above the water level and below the gully grid of an external waste gully complete with a 32mm clearing access and plug, where the waste emerges from the wall. Make good all disturbed surfaces and leave waste pipe properly supported.

Take out the *$ cold water/ hot water tap* to the **XXX** wash hand basin. Supply and fit a suitable 15mm (1/2") tap properly connected to the water supply. Ensure both water feeds have maintenance valves incorporated so that taps can be maintained without the need to drain down the water supply.
