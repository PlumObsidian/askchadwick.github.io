**Sewer investigation**

Thoroughly investigate the private sewer serving properties ……….. inclusive, by means of a closed circuit television camera or other suitable alternative method to establish the condition of the sewer and the location and nature of any defects, including all saddle joint connections and its connection with the public sewer. Consider the need to flush the pipework thoroughly using pressurised water prior to the CCTV survey – to ensure the pipework is clear and to ensure the best possible images. Provide a copy of the survey report (including video tape) to the Environmental Health Officer. On identifying any defects to the private sewer, excavate the ground to expose the defects and repair/renew as necessary. Before back-filling around the private sewer, contact the Environmental Health Officer (and if necessary the District Surveyor) to arrange a full inspection of any repairs undertaken. On completion test the private sewer to ensure that it is free from any obstructions and is self-cleansing. The final test must be witnessed by the Environmental Health Officer.
