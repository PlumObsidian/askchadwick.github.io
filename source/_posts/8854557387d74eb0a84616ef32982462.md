**Remove obstructions and potentially flammable materials from fire escape route**

Remove all bicycles, and accumulations of potentially flammable materials, from within the protected fire escape route. Undertake necessary management action to keep the ‘protected route’ free from obstructions that might hinder escape in the event of a fire, or which might aid the spread of a fire.
