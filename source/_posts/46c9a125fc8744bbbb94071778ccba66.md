**Rebuilt Brickwork**

Completely demolish **XXX** brick wall. Take out window frames, cills and lintels and set aside for re-use. Re-build brickwork using new or sound second-hand bricks to match original, bedded in suitable cement mortar including toothing and bonding to existing. Replace windows, frames, cills and lintels with new where necessary and reform any arches to match existing. Provide approved DPC to new brickwork as necessary.
