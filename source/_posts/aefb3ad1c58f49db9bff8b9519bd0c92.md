**Introductory Paragraph**

The Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 applies to the common parts of any house in multiple occupation, and requires responsible persons to “take such general fire precautions as may reasonably be required in the circumstances of the case to ensure that the premises are safe”, and to make and maintain a fire risk assessment. Where ‘responsible person’ is the ‘owner’ or the ‘person who has control of the premises’. Therefore the responsible person will usually be the landlord, but if the landlord is absentee and the “carrying on of the business” is undertaken by a managing agent, it may be the managing agent. It is enforced in London by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, but the Council also has to deal with any deficiencies in fire precautions that create a potential fire hazard.

British Standard 9999:2008 is the current Code of practice for fire safety in the design, management and use of buildings and provides guidance to ensure the fire safety of a building over its lifetime, and this requires the correct installation and maintenance of all fire safety provisions. It specifies that a building containing occupants who may be asleep requires a high level of management. The national guidance used in the drafting of this notice is endorsed by the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Under Secretaries of State for housing and fire safety and has received input from landlords.
