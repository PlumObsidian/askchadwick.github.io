## Category 2 hazards:

powers to take enforcement action
(1)The provisions mentioned in subsection (2) confer power on a local housing authority to take particular kinds of enforcement action in cases where they consider that a category 2 hazard exists on residential premises.

(2) The provisions are—

(a) section 12 (power to serve an improvement notice),

(b) section 21 (power to make a prohibition order),

(c) section 29 (power to serve a hazard awareness notice),

(d) section 265(3) and (4) of the Housing Act 1985 (power to make a demolition order), and

(e) section 289(2ZB) of that Act (power to make a slum clearance declaration).

(3) The taking by the authority of one of those kinds of enforcement action in relation to a particular category 2 hazard does not prevent them from taking either—

(a) the same kind of action again, or

(b) a different kind of enforcement action,

in relation to the hazard, where they consider that the action taken by them so far has not proved satisfactory.
