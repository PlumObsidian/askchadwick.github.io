**Prohibit smoking within the escape route**

No smoking should be allowed in common parts of the premises, as smoking materials or discarded cigarette butts can act as potential sources of ignition. The Smoke-free (Premises and Enforcement) Regulations 2006 also prohibit smoking within the common parts of a house or building in multiple occupation. In addition, Regulations controlling the management of houses in multiple occupation require the person managing the premises to “ensure that all common parts of the HMO are (a) maintained in good and clean decorative repair; (b) are maintained in a safe and working condition; and (c) are kept reasonably clear of obstruction.” **Take action to prohibit smoking within common parts.** You may prohibit smoking within any part of the premises if you make it clear when letting the premises that you have chosen to designate it as a ‘non-smoking premises’ and incorporate a ban on smoking within the property in the tenancy conditions.
