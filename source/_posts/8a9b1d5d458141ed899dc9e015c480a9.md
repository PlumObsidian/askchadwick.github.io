On 14th January 2025, the Government’s [Renters’
Rights Bill ](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3764) successfully passed its
third and final reading in the House of Commons and the
final draft of the bill has now been sent to the House of
Lords and is scheduled to be read on 4th February 2025.

If there are few or no amendments tabled by the Peers in
the House of Lords, then the Bill will complete the Lords
stage fairly quickly and is likely to get **Royal Assent
to become law in Spring 2025**.
