**Landlord Duty**

You have duties under the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 to arrange maintenance by a Gas Safe registered installer for all pipe work, appliances and flues, which you own and have provided for your tenants use.

The Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations state that landlords must only use a Gas Safe registered installer for maintenance and safety checks on gas equipment they own and provide for tenants use in domestic premises. You must check that the Gas Safe registered installer is competent to work in that specific area of gas. This is clearly marked on the back of the installerâ€™s [Gas Safe registration card](http://www.trustcorgi.com/consumer/CORGIIDCard.htmx). If in any doubt you can contact Gas Safe or [check their website](http://www.trustcorgi.com/findinstaller/CheckanInstaller.htmx) to see if the installer is registered.
