All bed sitting rooms/studios shall be provided with a fan assisted combination storage heater with thermostatically controlled top up convector heater. All bed sitting rooms/studios shall be provided with wall mounted electric panel heaters with timers and electronic thermostats.

Where it is not practicable to install storage heaters in kitchens, bathrooms or WC compartments on peak down flow heaters or otherwise can be installed.

All storage heaters shall have automatic charge control and a thermostatically controlled damper outlet.

For sizing and positioning of storage heaters regard shall be had to the method set out in DOM 8: Guide to the Design of Electric Space Heating Systems, The Electrical Heating and Ventilation Association, 2006.
