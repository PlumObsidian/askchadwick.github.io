**LPG appliances**

Arrange maintenance by a Gas Safe registered installer for all LPG appliances which you own and provide for tenants and have a Gas Safe registered installer carry out a safety check carried out at least once every 12 months.

In addition to maintenance, there are some further safety precautions to take with LPG heaters:

- be aware that cabinet heaters need a good supply of fresh air to burn properly so the room must be well ventilated;
- ensure any heaters have an atmosphere sensing device- it will shut the appliance off if the air quality is poor;
- Ensure that the correct size and type of gas bottle is being used.
- Be aware that outdoor heaters and not designed for use indoors.
