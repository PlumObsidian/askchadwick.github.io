Cut out the fractured section(s) of brick built wall and rebuild in sound salvaged bricks, or new bricks to match, set in sand/cement (3:1) mortar ensuring continuation of original bond toothed into sound sections of brickwork with joints struck to match existing as work proceeds. Alternatively repair the fractures by such other suitable method as may be agreed all to the Councilâ€™s Building Control Officers recommendations.
