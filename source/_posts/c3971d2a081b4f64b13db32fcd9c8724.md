**Glazing in partition (replace/ upgrade)**

Remove the existing unprotected glazing from the partition # specify exact position # along with associated beading etc. and suitably dispose of the materials. Replace with glazing having a minimum standard of fire resistance of 30 minutes correctly fitted in its frame in accordance with Appendix I to this schedule. On completion the glazing to be of a standard to satisfy the test criteria of relevant British Standard because fire-resisting glass should be marked with an identifiable name or trademark. Appropriate documentation to confirm the system level of fire resistance should be provided on completion of installation. Fire - resisting glass may have limited insulation capability, so that heat is radiated through the glass, and can cause ignition of flammable items on the side remote from the fire. It is therefore recommended that non-insulating glass is not used in the partition below 0.5m above floor level.
