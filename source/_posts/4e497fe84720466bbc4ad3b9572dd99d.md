**Electrical Installation Condition Report (DWELLING)**

Provide an "electrical installation condition report" for the electrical installation and fittings throughout the property.

The test report and remedial works are to be undertaken by a competent electrician, registered with a nationally recognised third party body such as Electrical Contractors Association (E.C.A.) ; National Association for Professional Inspectors and Testers (N.A.P.I.T.); National Inspection Council Electrical Installation Contracting (N.I.C.E.I.C.)

A copy of the electrical installation condition report is to be forwarded to the case officer.

Carry out all code 1 (Danger present. Risk of injury) and code 2 (Potentially dangerous. urgent remedial action required) remedial works, as listed in the electrical installation condition report, to bring the installation and fittings to a safe condition for continued use.

All work must be accompanied by either a Minor Works Certificate or an Electrical Installation Certificate as appropriate
