**Separate cooking facilities from escape route**

Construct a half-hour resisting construction, with half-hour fire-resisting, self-closing door to isolate the existing kitchen from the communal ‘protected escape route’. The new partition to be rigid, vertical, capable of supporting imposed loads, integrated securely into the adjacent building construction and constructed in accordance with current Building Regulations. Junctions with adjacent structural elements shall be constructed so that the structure maintains its fire integrity in the event of a fire, and is imperforate and sealed against the passage of the products of combustion. If the partition forms part of a ‘protected fire escape route’, the surface forming the escape route must have a Class 0 spread of fire. If the wall separates dwellings or a dwelling from the protected route, it may also have to comply with the Building Regulations and a Building Application should be submitted.

Provide and fix a fire-resistant door and frame set incorporating a fire-resisting glazed vision panel at eye level. Door, glazing and frame when fitted to have minimum standard of fire resistance of 30 minutes. An aperture must only be cut in a fire door by the manufacturer. The frame should be plumb and square, and securely fixed into the opening. Fill gaps between frame and wall/partition opening with intumescent mastic or paste. Fit a intimately fitted softwood or hardwood architrave, at least 15mm thick with a 15mm overlap onto both wall and door frame. Where door leaf is binding with the frame , relieve door by removal of minimum amounts of timber equally from door and frame. Fill gaps greater than 4mm by fitting solid timber of equivalent density to door and frame respectively. The timber to be screwed and glued using non-thermally softening glue. Minimum permitted size of timber infill is 6mm. The bottom edge of the door should be parallel to the floor finish so as not to bind and to leave a maximum gap of 10mm beneath the door when closed.

The door and frame when fitted to have minimum standard of fire resistance of 30 minutes. On completion the door to be close fitting with frame (maximum gap 4mm) and effectively self-closing to engage the latch. It is recommended that an overhead hydraulic closer is used. Hang on three steel or brass hinges with hinge blade size of 75-100mm by 27-33mm. The doors or frames are to be fitted down both jambs and along the head with intumescent strips and cold smoke seals. If the property is a listed building, it will be necessary to submit a listed building application to the Council’s Conservation and Urban Design Team in respect of these works.
