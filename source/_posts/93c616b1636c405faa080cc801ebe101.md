**Provide wash hand basin**

Provide in the **XXX** or other conveniently accessible and approved site, a suitable wash hand basin provided with adequate supplies of hot and cold water. Properly connect to the drainage system by means of a trapped waste pipe including all necessary gas, electrical or water supply connections to current Building Regulations requirements. Ensure both water feeds have maintenance valves incorporated so that taps can be maintained without the need to drain down the water supply.
