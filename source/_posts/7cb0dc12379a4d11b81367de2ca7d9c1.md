**Repair cracked lath and plaster CEILING (single)**

Rake out the crack(s) in the plaster to the ceiling # specify exact positions #, key to receive new plaster, remove any loose, unkeyed, damp, perished or otherwise defective plaster, effectively and thoroughly fill the crack(s) and plaster where removed. Finish smooth and flush with adjacent areas and leave sound and secure and with minimum standard of fire resistance of 30 minutes. Junctions with adjacent structural elements shall be constructed so that the structure maintains its fire integrity in the event of a fire, and is imperforate and sealed against the passage of the products of combustion on completion. Fill any gaps around cables and pipes with intumescent paste.
