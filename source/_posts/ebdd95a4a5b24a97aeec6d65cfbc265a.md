**Remove hook or door holder (General clause)**

Remove all door wedges, hooks and ties or other devices capable of hold self-closing fire doors in the open position. Ensure that each door is fitted with a self-closing mechanism, preferably a hydraulic top of door closer, capable of fully closing the door against its stops, by over-riding the lock latch, on completion.
