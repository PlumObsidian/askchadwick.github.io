**Draught proofing to sash windows**

Provide and fit draught strips to all the sash windows. Products should be manufactured to BS 7386 and installed to BS 7880. Remove all the beading which the windows use as runners to run up and down on and replace them with special beading which has a bristle strip embedded into them. Additionally, embed bristle strip into the windows where the top and bottom windows meet to stop drafts coming in. This requires removing the windows and using a router to cut a channel in the wood.

Alternatively,

If you donâ€™t want to remove the beading, then a combination of compression draught strip and bristle strip shall be fitted in the following way: For the lower sash, fit bristle strip to both sides of the beading on the inside. Cut the strip to size then with the window closed nail/screw it in place. Do exactly the same for the upper sash **BUT on** the outside. Were both windows meet in the middle fit bristle strip on both sides with the bristles facing each other just touching? This will stop draughts coming in the middle. With the window open, fit self-adhesive foam or rubber strip on the underside of the top and bottom edge of the window to stop draughts coming in there when the upper and lower sash close onto the frame.
