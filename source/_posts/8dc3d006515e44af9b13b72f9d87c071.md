**Change catches/locks to door**

Remove the existing lock (s) from the â€¦.. door. Fit a new latch with a positive latching mechanism comprising steel or brass nib (not rollerball catch) which is preferably surface mounted, secured to the door with fixings to a minimum depth of 25mm. Any lock, including deadlock, must be fitted with a turnkey mechanism, not necessitating use of a key on the room side. Infill any voids in the doors with suitable intumescent paste or intumescent plaster. Ensure that the self-closing mechanism is capable of fully closing the door against the door stop, by over-riding the latch. On completion the fire door to fit the frame with a maximum gap of 4mm between door edges and frame.
