**Draught Proofing to internal door**

Supply and fit draught strips to the door along the bottom and sides with a range of 6mm and a compression allowance of 3mm. Products should be manufactured to the current version of BS 7386 and installed to the current version of BS 7880. If the gaps to the door are large, provide and fix new pieces of treated timber to the bottom and top so as to eliminate the large gaps before the draught strips are fitted.
