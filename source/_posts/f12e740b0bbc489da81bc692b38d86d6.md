**Underpinning: General clauses**

When underpinning works are necessary, it is in your interest to employ the services of a Specialist Contractor experienced in works of this nature.

Underpinning/foundation reinforcement may generally be carried out using any patented or proprietary method provided the Councilâ€™s Building Control Officer is consulted prior to the commencement of works and that any recommendations made are incorporated into the scheme of works.
