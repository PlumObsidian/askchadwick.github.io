**Guarding to Roof Terraces**

Provide a weather resistant balustrade to the roof terrace that is used for recreation. The guarding should at least be 1100mm high, designed and constructed so as to discourage children climbing on it and strong enough to support the weight of an adult leaning against it. There should be no openings to guarding which would allow a 100mm sphere to pass through. All works to comply with current Building Regulations.
