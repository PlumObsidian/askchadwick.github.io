**Under Pinning Works**

Carry out underpinning works to the inadequately founded wall(s) using a method approved by the Building Control Officer, including reinstating all excavated earth works and making good all disturbed areas. (It is in your interest to employ the services of a Specialist Contractor experienced in works of this nature).
