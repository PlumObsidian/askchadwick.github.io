**Casement/Metal window**

Take out the casement window. Fit in lieu thereof a suitable single glazed window complete with hinges, stays and fasteners. The total area of the window or aggregation of all windows within the room is to be not less than 1/10th of the floor area of the room and be so constructed that a portion of the window equal in area to not less than 1/20th of the floor area of the room is openable.

Alternatively, provide and fix a double glazed window to comply with the current versions of BS 5713 and BS 6262. The units must have an inner pane of low-E glass with a gap between the panes of 12mm and 20mm and be fitted with trickle ventilation. All openings to be draught stripped, preferably with two separate strips. Metal frames must incorporate a thermal break.

**Outside conservation areas**.

Provide and fit new **$ metal** double-glazed timber windows to match as far as possible the current design, which will achieve FENSA certification. The windows are to incorporate trickle vents that comply with current Building Regulations. The openable part of the window must be capable of achieving a minimum of one twentieth of the floor area of the room its serves, and if there is more than one window the combined openable areas must exceed one twentieth. Where the size of the openable part(s) of the window(s) is below one twentieth and is restricted by the available dimensions of the opening in which the window frame is housed, every effort shall be made to maximise the openable area available.

Metal frames must incorporate a thermal break.

Low level glazing in the windows that is wholly or partially within 800mm from floor level is in a critical location. Safety glass that complies with the current version of BS 6206 Class C or above/ BS EN 12600 must be fitted in these locations. The safety glazing should be permanently marked in accordance with the current version of BS 6206 etc. The markings should still be visible after the glass has been fitted and the beading and pointing has been completed.

Alternatively the windows must be permanently protected by guards which are 800mm from fall level and have gaps between the vertical bars less than 75mm. Guards with horizontal bars are not suitable.

Provide and fit suitable opening limiters to casements to restrict the distance that the window can be opened to 100mm.

Regard must be had to security in the design of openings as well as the risk of collision when openable parts are opened with walkways or access areas.
