s235 of the  Housing Act 2004 grants local housing authorities the power to request documents from relevant persons for purposes related to the enforcement of housing conditions.

## Here are the key points about Section 235:

### Section 235 Power of Request:

A person authorized in writing by a local housing authority can require a relevant person to provide documents necessary for the authority to exercise its functions under Parts 1 to 4 of the Housing Act 2004. These documents can be related to any premises and can be required for the purpose of investigating whether any offense has been committed under these parts.

### Notice Requirements:

The notice requiring the provision of documents <u>must</u> specify the documents required and include information about the possible consequences of not complying with the notice.

### Local Authority Authority:

The local housing authority must be <u>authorized</u> in writing to exercise this power. The notice must be given to a relevant person, which typically includes the owner or occupier of the premises.
