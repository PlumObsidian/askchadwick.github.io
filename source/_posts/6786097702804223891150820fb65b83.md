**Windows** **â€“** **Internal Cill heights**

The cill heights to the double hung sash windows in **XXX** are less than 1.1 metres above internal floor level. This would facilitate a fall from an openable window by a vulnerable person. This is particularly marked in the **XXX** windows, where the cill height is less than 0.7 metres. A fall onto the hard concrete surface outside these windows would probably result in a death or major injury. Works are required to negate this risk.
