Investigate and ascertain the cause of the dampness affecting the **XXX** (location) in the dwelling

Investigate the cause of water leaking from the rear of the WC suite and replace or repair the appropriate component, as necessary. Test and on completion ensure that the WC is clean, leak free and correctly operating. Examine the flooring surrounding the WC suite, to ensure that the WC suite is properly secured to the floor (see also clause below).

Open up and examine the suspended timber flooring to the shared bathroom, in close proximity to the WC suite. Remove all rotten and defective boards, joists, wall plates and other floor timbers and replace using sound, well-seasoned, impregnated timber of suitable dimensions. Leave the floor in a sound movement free condition on completion.

Identify the source of the swelling, cracking and leaking on the dormer ceiling. Undertake a course of remedial works, as necessary. Make good any disturbed and affected surfaces.
