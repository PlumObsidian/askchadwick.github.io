For severe condensation problems. Usually combine this with some improvement to heating control but a basic clause:

| 1.1                    | Employ a condensation specialist company to design and commission a ventilation system.<br><br>Throughout the flat, provide:<br><br>- A Positive Pressure Ventilation system<br>- Provide a condensation control unit fitted to an external wall operated by introducing fresh, filtered air into the property.<br>- In colder weather, the automated temperature sensor must be designed to activate and the unit will gently temper the incoming air to reduce heat loss.<br>- Where condensation is present within a bedroom or lounge environment, boost extract is undesirable and therefore the preferred solution is a Heat Recovery ventilator to provide quiet, trickle ventilation, whilst maintaining up to 80% heat recovery, reducing heat loss and minimising running costs. |
