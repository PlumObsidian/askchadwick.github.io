The Government’s overarching goal of the Renters’ Rights Bill is to rebalance the relationship between
tenants and landlords by offering greater protections to renters while ensuring that landlords meet
higher standards of responsibility.

- **Enhancing tenant security**:  The Bill seeks to give tenants
  greater peace of mind that they will not face sudden eviction
  by abolishing evictions under Section 21

- **Ensuring affordability**:   Landlords will not be able to accept
  offers over the advertised asking price and rent increases will
  only be allowed once per year. Tenants will need at least two
  months’ notice and will have the right to challenge excessive
  increases through a tribunal.

- **Improving housing standards**:  A new Decent Homes
  Standard will be published and applied to the private rental sector.

- **Eliminating discriminatory practices**:  The Bill seeks
  to eradicate discrimination in the rental market by banning
  “no DSS” and “no children” policies.

- **Creating a more transparent system**:
  A Landlord Ombudsman will be introduced to handle
  tenant complaints and offer binding resolutions, and
  a digital property portal will be launched to enable
  local councils to enforce legal obligations.
