**Repair artificial lighting**

Overhaul the lighting throughout the ‘protected escape route’, so that the entire escape route in the event of a fire is adequately illuminated, and controlled by switches that enable the lights to be operated from either direction, with easily accessible switches situated on each landing. Any timer controlled switches shall be set so that a resident has sufficient time to reach their location before the lights switch off.
