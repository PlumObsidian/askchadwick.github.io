**Windowsâ€™ Restrictors**

Provide suitable proprietary restrictors to limit the window openings to a maximum of 100 mm (10cm) to windows:

'The proprietary restrictors should be easy to over-ride by an adult in the event of a fire.

The proprietary restrictors must be strong enough to withstand damage arising from every day use.

All glazing extending to within 1100mm of the floor is to be suitably guarded with toughened or laminated safety glass or guarded with a safety screen or suitably located and firmly fixed rails.

If double hung sliding sash (DHSS) window, the restrictor should be of such design so as to prevent the lower sash being raised above 100mm and to allow the top sash to fully open.

The 2 openings should provide good ventilation and assist in cooling to reduce the hazard of excess heat in summer.
