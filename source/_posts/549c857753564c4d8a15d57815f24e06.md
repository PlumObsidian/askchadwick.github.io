**Remove all fire-door wedges or other hold-open arrangements**

It is a statutory requirement under the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 for person or people who may have control of any premises to ensure that the premises and any equipment provided in connection with fire fighting, fire detection and warning, or emergency escape routes and exits in the ‘house in multiple occupation’ are maintained in efficient working order and in good repair. If key doors are found to be prevented from closing properly, it is also an offence under the appropriate HMO Management Regulations and can invalidate your insurance cover. You must take the necessary measures to ensure that all the key fire doors are effectively self-closing at all times.
