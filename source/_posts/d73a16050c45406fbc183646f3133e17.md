Although unlikley to be in effect until Spring 2025:

- **Consider a Rent Protection product**
  New laws may mean it takes longer to regain possession of your property if a tenant fails to
  pay rent. Protect yourself against this by taking out a rent protection product.

- **Be diligent with your tenant referencing**
  Use robust and stringent tenant referencing
  systems.

- **Optimise your property**
  The best rental properties will always achieve the best rents and attract the best tenants. Ensure that your property is in good
  decorative order and presents well to prospective tenants. Also, if your property is suffering from mould or damp, now is the
  time to get it addressed, before the new [Decent Homes Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/a-decent-home-definition-and-guidance) is applied to the private rented sector.
