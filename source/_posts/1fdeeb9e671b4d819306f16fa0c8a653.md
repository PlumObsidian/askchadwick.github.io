**SOFFIT (underdraw to provide 30 minute fire resistence)**

Upgrade the existing soffit #specify position # by underdrawing with 12.5mm plasterboard. Scrim joints with 90mm hessian scrim and set with 5mm gypsum plaster finish. Junctions with adjacent structural elements shall be constructed so that the structure maintains its fire integrity in the event of a fire, and is imperforate and sealed against the passage of the products of combustion on completion. Fill any gaps around cables and pipes with intumescent paste.
