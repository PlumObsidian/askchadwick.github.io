**Seal gaps and voids**

Infill all gaps between walls, walls and ceilings, gaps around pipes penetrating walls and ceilings, gaps around fire-resisting doorsets with suitable intumescent filler or sealant or specialist intumescent plaster. Intumescent plaster is a chemically modified two-part powder and can also be used to fill over-large lock and latch recesses in timber doors. Where large gaps exist conventional intumescent sealants may not be appropriate and products such as Firefoam may be used.
