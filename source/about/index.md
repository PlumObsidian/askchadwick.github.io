**Sir Edwin Chadwick** KCB (24 January 1800 â€“ 6 July 1890) was an English
 social reformer who is noted for his leadership in reforming the Poor Laws in England
 and instituting major reforms in urban sanitation and public health.

Chadwick pioneered the use of scientific surveys to identify all phases of a complex social problem, and pioneered the use of systematic long-term inspection programmes to make sure the reforms operated as planned.

**Mr Bog** however, is a Local Government Officer of a certain vintage.
Finding keeping up with a plethora of new legislation a challenging task and being a mentor
to newer practitioners, he put together **Ask Chadwick** as a repository of possibly
useful links and guides to Environmental Health in the U.K.

As this is largely experimental and presently a one man operation, he would request only that you
THINK FOR YOURSELF and cross check things you read.

Mr Bog.
